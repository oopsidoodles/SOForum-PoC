Proof-of-Concept to create a StackOverflow-like app

Like the generic Todo list project but with questions and answers instead

* Frontend done using React, TypeScript, Redux, Bootstrap(Reactstrap)

Many things missing but purpose was to get comfortable with Redux

I will be using ideas from this project in future projects (ex. typings for reducers)

### Todo
* answers for questions
* make everything pretty
* more specific types for components and reducers
* backend for data persistence (+ add redux-thunk for async reducers)
